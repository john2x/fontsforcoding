title: Fonts for Coding &bullet; About
---

This website is a place where programmers who, like me, are in a constant search for the perfect programming font can look around and conveniently search for their "Holy Grail".

Since the choice of a font is very personal, the items showcased here are thus sorted alphabetically.

All screenshots are taken on my machine, with the following setup:

- MacBook Air 11" running OS X Mavericks
- Emacs 24.3 (GUI/cocoa) using the [flatui-theme](https://github.com/john2x/flatui-theme.el) theme
- 80 characters wide, and stretching along the Air's screen for height

<h3 id="font-stats">Font Stats</h3>

#### Recommended size

This is the recommended minimum size a font can be used. Of course, if you prefer smaller fonts, that's up to you. But for the purposes of this website, this is the smallest size a font can get for me while still being comfortable readable.

#### Lines per screen

With ultrabooks becoming a legitimate machine for development work nowadays, I find it important to know just how many lines of code I can get per screen.

This made up unit measures the number of lines that can be typed to fill the entire screen of an 11" MacBook Air (1366x768).
This is assuming the size used is the recommended size.

#### Ambiguous characters

If a font has any ambiguous characters, they will be listed here. e.g. `O vs. 0`, `l vs. I vs. 1`, etc. If a font doesn't have any ambiguous characters, this will be <span class="label label-success">None</span>.

#### Unicode support

How much the font supports Unicode characters. There are 4 possible values:

<ul>
<li><span class="label label-success">Full</span> - All Unicode characters are available.</li>
<li><span class="label label-info">Limited</span> - Only a limited subset of Unicode characters are available. But although limited, it's still good enough for "average" use.</li>
<li><span class="label label-warning">Very Limited</span> - Very limited subset of Unicode characters are available. Only the most common/popular characters are supported.</li>
<li><span class="label label-danger">None</span> - No Unicode characters at all.</li>
</ul>

**Note:** Unless the font project page explicitly mentions having full/limited Unicode support, this stat will be just whatever I can reasonably test and see (i.e. it won't be accurate). If you find a font's unicode stat is incorrect, please see below about contributions.

<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>

The source is available at [GitHub][github]. Contributions, especially with regards to font information and Unicode support, are very welcome.

If you find your favorite font missing, let me know with links to download and the project page and I'll add it as soon as I can (I'd like to keep the screenshots consistent).

Either an email (`john2x at gmail`), [tweet][twitter] or pull-request will do.
