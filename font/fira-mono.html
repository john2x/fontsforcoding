<p>Fira Sans (initially called Feura Sans) is a sans-serif typeface designed by Erik Spiekermann, Ralph du Carrois, Anja Meiners and Botio Nikoltchev of Carrois Type Design for the Firefox OS and released in 2013, initially under the Apache License and then under the SIL Open Font License. It is closely related to the Meta typeface designed and developed by Spiekermann in the late 1980s which is being used as the brand typeface of the Mozilla Foundation.
